"""Identifier indexes, converted from beagleutil.ChromIds, SampleIds and
ThreadSafeIndexer.

In the Java program ChromIds and SampleIds are global: an identifier gets the
next index the first time any part of the program asks for it.  The genetic
map registers chromosomes first, the VCF file registers its samples (in
column order) and its chromosomes next, and the IBD segments register the
remaining identifiers.  The Java program prints chromosome indices, not names,
in its "position missing" message, so the order of registration is kept.
