"""Line input, converted from blbutil.InputIt.

``InputIt.fromGzipFile(File)`` opens a file, decompresses it when its name
ends in ``.gz`` (BGZF through net.sf.samtools.util.BlockCompressedInputStream,
other gzip files through java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream), and returns its
lines as java.io.BufferedReader.readLine() does: a line ends at ``\\n``,
``\\r`` or ``\\r\\n`` (Javadoc).  ``InputIt.fromStdIn()`` does the same for
standard input without decompression.  Bytes are decoded as UTF-8, the
default charset of Java 18 and later, with malformed input replaced by
U+FFFD.  Lines are produced lazily, so an error in the middle of a file is
reported when that point is reached, as in Java.

A read error ends the program through ``Utilities.exit("Error reading " +
reader, e)``.  InputIt reads the first line in its constructor, through a
BufferedReader of 4,194,304 characters, and names the decompressing stream
in that message; later reads name the BufferedReader (observed).  Java also
prints the object's identity hash (``@76ed5528``), which is not reproduced.
This conversion names the stream for an error in the first 4,194,304
characters, or before the end of the first line if that is longer; for BGZF
files, where Java's first read can stop at a block boundary, this boundary
has not been checked against the jar, and neither have the messages for a
damaged BGZF file.
